# Introduction
This webpage is built with Docsify and markdown, then hosted on Github Pages. 
## Docsify
[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) is a static documentation site generator, or "Magical," as their landing page claims. It is very easy to get started [here.](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) Support and community links can be found on the website from there.
Docsify takes markdown files and creates valid html code for websites, much like many other static site generators. The menu bar on the left goes into further detail on Docsify.
