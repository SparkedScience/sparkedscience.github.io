# Why Docsify
Docsify integrates easily with Github Pages, and it was the easiest to set up out of the technical solutions. I attempted HAX11ty, but the template build kept failing on Github Pages after I went through set up. (Sorry about that one, I just couldn't get it to work) I stuck with Docsify over the easier, not as technical solutions as it worked with Github Pages, instead of editing files through the cpanel on Reclaim Hosting. Errors are more verbal outside of cpanel, as I have come to learn.
